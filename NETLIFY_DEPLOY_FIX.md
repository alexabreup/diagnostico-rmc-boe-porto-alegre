# Netlify Deploy Fix - Glob Module Error

## Problem
The Netlify deploy was failing with the following error:
```
Error: Cannot find module 'glob'
Require stack:
- /opt/build/repo/scripts/fix-status-validation.js
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by using `glob` version `^10.3.0` which is ESM-only, but the scripts were trying to import it using CommonJS `require()` syntax. The newer versions of glob (v10+) dropped CommonJS support.

## Solution
1. **Downgraded glob version**: Changed from `^10.3.0` to `^8.1.0` in `package.json`
2. **Enhanced error handling**: Added directory existence check in `fix-status-validation.js`
3. **Improved dependency installation**: Updated netlify build script to explicitly include dev dependencies

## Files Modified
- `diagnostico-rmc-poa-elt/package.json`: Downgraded glob version
- `diagnostico-rmc-poa-elt/scripts/fix-status-validation.js`: Added error handling
- `diagnostico-rmc-poa-elt/scripts/netlify-build.js`: Enhanced dependency installation

## Verification
- ✅ Local build test passed: `npm run build:netlify`
- ✅ Status validation script works: `node scripts/fix-status-validation.js`
- ✅ All dependencies install correctly

## Next Steps
The fix is ready for deployment. The next Netlify build should complete successfully without the glob module error.

## Technical Notes
- Glob v8.1.0 still supports CommonJS require() syntax
- The warning about deprecated glob versions is expected and doesn't affect functionality
- All validation warnings in the build output are component-level warnings, not build errors
